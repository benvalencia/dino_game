# Dino Game

Get ready to keep jumping! "Dino Jump" is a fun mini-game built entirely in JavaScript, where you control a cute dinosaur that must dodge obstacles by jumping with the keyboard keys.  

The goal is to go as far as possible without hitting cacti or falling into traps. Every second you survive increases your score, challenging you to beat your own records.  

Features:

- Simple controls: press the spacebar or the â†‘ key to jump.  
- Precise collision detection and smooth animations.  
- Dynamic scoring system with saved high scores.  
- Retro design inspired by the classic offline browser game.  

Perfect for practicing programming logic, animations with intervals, and keyboard event handling in JavaScript.
